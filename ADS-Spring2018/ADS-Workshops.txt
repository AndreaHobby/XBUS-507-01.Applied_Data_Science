Applied Workshop Scenario 1

You are to treat this from the perspective of a business case analysis. As such, establish a business problem to resolve, explain your data set, what steps you intend to take for feature selection and why they are important. 

Please use concrete examples to make your argument less abstract. As such, this will require you to find a data set, which cannot be related to your Capstone project.  You will need to establish a hypothesis, explain your data set, what steps you intend to take for feature selection and why they are important. Additionally, it may be helpful to select a novel data set, from a subject where you have a level of expertise. Please use examples  and references from your data. Finally, please provide access your data, via a URL to its source or as an attachment, depending on file size.
